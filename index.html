        <h1>How to install pip for VS Code</h1>
        <p>pip should already be installed in 'python for VS Code' but for whatever resason it is not then follow these simple instructions</p>
        <p>search pip install on your browser<p/>
        <p>click on the first result</p>
        <p>you should now be on the pip website and there should be a button near the top left corner which says 'pip install pip' this is the url<p/>
        <p>make a new file on VS Code or just open the jupyter notebook</p>
        <p>After copying and pasting the url on a new page there should be a huge mess of code and that code is pip</p> 
        <p>copy all of the code and paste it in the terminal on VS Code</P>
        <p>After you run the code on VS Code pip will start to install and after giving some permissions save it as a file.</P>
        <p> If there is an error than most likely pip was already installed in 'python for VS Code' in which case just run 'python for VS Code.'</p>
